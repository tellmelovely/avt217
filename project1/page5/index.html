    <h1>Kali Uchi's After the Storm ft. Tyler the Creator</h1>
    <p> So if you need a hero (if you need a hero)
Just look in the mirror (just look in the mirror)
No one's gonna save you now
So you better save yourself
And everybody's hurting
Everybody's going through it
But you just can't give up now
'Cause you gotta save yourself
Yeah, gotta hang on, baby </p>
