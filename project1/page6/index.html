    <h1>After the Storm</h1>
  <ul>
    The sun'll come out
  Nothing good ever comes easy
  I know times are rough
  But winners don't quit
  So don't you give up
  The sun'll come out
  But we've been struggling endless days
  Someday we'll find the love
  'Cause after the storm's
  When the flowers
  <a href="../page7/index.html">bloom</a>
  </ul>
