    <h1>After the Storm</h1>
  <ul>
  <li><a href="page7/index.html">The sun'll come out
Nothing good ever comes easy
I know times are rough
But winners don't quit
So don't you give up
The sun'll come out
But we've been struggling endless days
Someday we'll find the love
'Cause after the storm's
When the flowers bloom</a></li>
