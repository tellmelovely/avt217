    <h1></h1>

    the sun'll come out
    nothing good ever comes easy
    I know times are rough
    but winners don't quit
    so don't you give up
    the sun'll come out
    but we've been struggling endless days
    someday we'll find the love
    'cause after the storm's
    when the flowers
  <a href="../page7/index.html">bloom</a>
  </ul>
