    <h1>Kali Uchi's After the Storm ft. Tyler the Creator</h1>
    <p> Kali, what you mean?
I take it offensive
'Cause I'm the hottest flower boy
That popped up on the scene
Feeling better, better than ever
'Cause your umbrella, brella (brella, light)
Sun is beaming on me like headlights beaming on Bambi
Now let's pretend the street is the room
And you are a Camry
'Cause your drama candid
The Tito to my Randy
Now let's produce some thrillers
My chocolate wit' yo' vanilla, uh </p>
