  <a href="../page8/index.html">kali,</a>
  what you mean?
  I take it offensive
  'cause I'm the hottest flower boy
  that popped up on the scene
  feeling better, better than ever
  'cause your umbrella, brella (brella, light)
  sun is beaming on me like headlights beaming on Bambi
  now let's pretend the street is the room
  and you are a camry
  'cause your drama candid
  the tito to my randy
  now let's produce some thrillers
  my chocolate wit' yo' vanilla, uh
  </ul>
